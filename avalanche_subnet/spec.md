# Avalanche Subnet Plan

## Features
- Voters on chain get rewarded with separate tokens, say govAVAX for interacting on this governance subnet
    - This is with the intention of encouraging interaction and activity on the protocol, which pushes forward changes in the ecosystem. These wouldn't be designed to be a monetary reward, but rather would have utility in the sense of a credibility system within the governance space.
    - Users could redeem these tokens for certain benefits such as NFTs that could be displayed in other aspects of the Avalanche ecosystem (think Avalanche Forum, Avalanche Discord, third party NFT marketplaces)

- Extremely low or potentially no transaction fees (recognize that this would be hard to implement logically)
    - This would also encourage more activity because people would submit votes but wouldn't have to pay any gas fees.

- Would be targeted only for governance purposes
    - Other contracts could be deployed on the chain and would be able to build on top of the functionality of the main governance contract. They would also be able to provide / extend / use the utility of the govAVAX tokens in order to further expand the ecosystem for the protocol's governance subnet.

## Questions / TBD Details
- With these logistics, it doesn't seem like someone would benefit from being a validator. Simple, but not necessarily sound, ideas to fix this would be to reward validators with the same govAVAX tokens that could be minted by participating. This would make the token extremely inflationary, but if used as a rewards system where users spent their tokens for certain rewards, the ecosystem could still be successful.
